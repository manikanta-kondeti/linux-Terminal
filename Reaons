we use sig handler to capture the signal and redirect from that point .

for eg: if we type ctrl+c  when a c program is running then it have some default function it will  capture signal and comes out from the process .
  in a similar way if we want know the dead signal of a child process then we need to capture the signal from the child process .
  so for that purpose we keep sig_handler  function 1  in which the first parameter is the  signal number !
  void signal_handler-for-ctrl+c(int signumber)
  {
	  if (signum==2 || signum==20)
	  {
		  then capture that signal which corresponds to ctrl+c;
	  }
  }
